# PowerShell Syntax

    ## **Everything** is an object (even text)!
    - Objects (for simplicity) have both properties and methods

## Built-In CmdLet's and adv. functions should follow the {Verb}-{Noun} syntax but it is not required

    # PowerShell has an approved verb list
    Get-Verb

## Each CmdLet has their own set of parameters

## Example

    {Verb}-{Nount} -{parameter} {value}
    Get-Process -name dns
