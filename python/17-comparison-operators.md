# Python Comparison Operators
> Comparison operators let you specify conditions for comparing values and finding values that match specified patterns.

| Operator | Description    | Example |
|------|--------------|-------------|
|in|Evaluates to true if it finds a variable in the specified sequence and false otherwise.|x in y, here in results in a 1 if x is a member of sequence y.|
|not in|Evaluates to true if it does not finds a variable in the specified sequence and false otherwise.|x not in y, here not in results in a 1 if x is not a member of sequence y.|
|is|Evaluates to true if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same object and false otherwise.|x is y, here is results in 1 if id(x) equals id(y).|
|is not|Evaluates to false if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same object and true otherwise.|x is not y, here is not results in 1 if id(x) is not equal to id(y).|
|==|If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.|(a == b) is not true.|
|!=|If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.|(a != b) is true.|
|<>|If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	|(a <> b) is true. This is similar to != operator.|
|>|If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.|(a > b) is not true.|
|<|If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.|(a < b) is true.|
|>=|If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.|(a >= b) is not true.|
|<=|If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.|(a <= b) is true|
