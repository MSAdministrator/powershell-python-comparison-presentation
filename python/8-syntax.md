- Objects (for simplicity) have both properties and methods

## Built-In libraries and packages/modules should be named without any spaces, dashes, special characters

    # Python has guidelines called PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal)
    
    PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code

## Tabs/Spaces
    Python requires that indentation is 4 spaces
